# Advertisement Processing System

## Overview
This project was created for the **Applied Software Engineering** module and implements the use case "Advertisement Processing" for the case study **"IT in the Valley"**. The code provides an overview of different tasks and concepts including class implementation, the Command Pattern, OCL (Object Constraint Language) implementation, and unit testing, all developed in Java using **NetBeans IDE**.

The primary goal of the system is to simulate the process of managing advertisements submitted by advertisers. 

## Key Components
The entire functionality of the system is contained within a single file, named Advertisement_Processing.java. 

- **Advertisement Class**
- **Advertiser Class**
- **Employee Class**
- **MarketingDeptEmployee Class**
- **Editor Class**
- **SystemClass**
- **ProcessingCenter Class**

## Tasks Implemented
### 1. Class Implementation
The project contains various classes, each implementing different functionalities related to the advertisement process.

### 2. Command Pattern
The Command Pattern is used to encapsulate the actions of reviewing, approving, and rejecting advertisements. 

### 3. OCL Implementation
The project integrates Object Constraint Language (OCL) for enforcing rules such as unique advertisement IDs, valid status checks, and validation of advertisement details.

### 4. Unit Testing
Unit testing has been performed using the **Junit and Hamcrest Framework** to ensure the correctness and reliability of each class.
